<h1>Week 06 Learning Journal - Rhys Bush</h1>

<h2>Learning Activities and Resources</h2>
<p>Watched the week 06 in-person lecture in Panopto: https://jcu.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c617ee32-bfc9-4509-b104-b28d00c67079</p>

<h2>Estimated Hours</h2>
<p>3 hours.</p>

<h2>Content Insights</h2>
<p>I found that watching the lecture twice helped me gain a greater understanding of the expectations surrounding the group project. Every team member updating the Trello cards relevant to them is more efficient and realistic to a business environment, when compared to choosing a "Trello board master." Distrubuting tasks to team members so they are independent, elimating the need to wait for another task to be completed is efficient in a team project.</p>


<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>After re-watching the in-person lecture, I realised all of the project-centric skills that are developed during the group project are applicable to most workplaces. After communicating with my teammates, I have reflected on my leadership skills and decided to take a direct approach on asking questions around the progress of each assigned task. This will allow for me to better track where the group may need to spend more time learning and developing for. Stand up meetings are a great way for every member of a group to track each other's progress on assigned tasks, discuss any roadblocks, and the goals set during the coming week. This is a popular industry-wide practice in the IT sector and practicing this in a real-world scenario will provide valuable experience that employers are looking for in job applicants.</p>
