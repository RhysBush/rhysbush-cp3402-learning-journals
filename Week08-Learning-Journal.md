<h2>Learning Experiment</h2>
<p>For the learning experiment, I tested my hypothesis: "Typing my insights into a word document when watching lecture videos helps knowledge retention equal to writing insights on paper."  This was done by writing physical insights for CP3402's first pre-lecture video in week 02, then typing insights for the first video in week 03. I then waited 72 hours before attempting to recall all notes recorded. Any insights missed or that weren't present were marked as incorrect. I found a small but measurable 8% increase in recall when hand writing insights in comparison to typing on a keyboard. Despite this, I will continue to type my insights as the efficiency gained from faster note-taking allowed me to watch lectures faster and increased by subjective enjoyment in the note taking process.</p>

<h2>Career/Employability/Learning Insights</h2>
<p>Challenging assumptions I have made throughout my years in high school and university can only provide two possible outcomes: My current study habbits and learning strategies are optimal and does not need to be changed, or the improvements measured should be made. This can apply throughout my studies, but also in any career path I may choose, as I may hold suboptimal assumptions on how I complete a task for my employer. In addition, tradeoffs of perfectionism for efficiency is a useful consideration for any learning experiment. For example, if the gain in knowledge retention was greater, I may have considered hand writing pre-lecture notes in future, but the increase in time taken to complete a video was too great for the small improvement to be of consideration. In the future, I would like to conduct learning experiments to further challenge aspects of my approach to studying. For example: Watching pre-lecture videos before midday in comparison to after noon.</p>
